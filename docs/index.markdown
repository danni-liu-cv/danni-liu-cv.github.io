Hi there! :)


I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://ai4lt.anthropomatik.kit.edu/english/index.php) (KIT) advised by [Jan Niehues](https://ai4lt.anthropomatik.kit.edu/english/21_92.php). I started my Ph.D. with the same advisor at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/department-advanced-computing-sciences), where I also completed my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence. I was a research intern at [Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com/) and [Nuance Communications](https://www.nuance.com/index.html). Before my research roles, I worked as a business intelligence consultant at [Open Line](https://openline.nl/).

Here is my [CV][1].

Some research areas that particularly interest me:
- Multilingual representation learning
- Speech-to-text processing
- Cross-lingual and cross-modal generalization
