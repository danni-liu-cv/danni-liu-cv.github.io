Iâ€™m a native speaker of Mandarin Chinese, although my formal/scientific communication in it might be a bit awkward.

At home I speak English and a bit of German. My German currently still needs quite some work in grammar and vocabulary.

My Dutch used to be decent, but it has suffered from catastrophic forgetting, especially with interference from German.
